# 1-percent-off-calculator
Quick calculator that takes 1% off the amount input by user.

This was a tiny program I created on 12/31/2019 and was last modified 1/4/2020. 

I created this program to use at my family's cell phone store. We regularly need to know how much 1% off of customers' payroll checks is. I wanted to make a more effiient way for us to calculate this, so I quickly made this program to use in that moment. Nearly 3 years later, we're still using this every week!
